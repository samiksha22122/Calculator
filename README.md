# **Calculator Project**

This is a simple calculator application built to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is written in **[language/tool you used, e.g., Python, Java, etc.]** and is designed to be user-friendly and efficient.

---

## **Features**
- Perform **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.
- Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., dividing by zero or entering non-numeric values).
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Easily extendable to support advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square roots, exponents).

## **How to Run the Project**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator-project
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # For Python example
   python calculator.py
   ```

## **Usage**
1. Enter the first number.
2. Choose the operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The result will be displayed.

Example:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50
```
